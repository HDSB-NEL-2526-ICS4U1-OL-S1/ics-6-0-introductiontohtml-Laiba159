  <h2> Something About Me </h2>
  <p> When I was younger, I would consume 2 sandwiches of nutella almost every day. </i> It was so yummy! </i> 
  <br>
  <b> However, </b> I do not do that anymore, as I know the significant health impact from doing such. <b> 
  Although </b>, I wish I could eat everything in this world without having to worry about my health, calories, and much more.
