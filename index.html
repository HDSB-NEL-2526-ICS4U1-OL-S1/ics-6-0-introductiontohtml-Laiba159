  <h1> Something About Me... </h1>
  <p>
    When I was younger, I would consume <b> 2 sandwiches </b> of nutella almost every day. <i> It was so yummy! </i>
    <br>
    <b> However, </b> I do not do that anymore, as I know the significant health impact from doing such.
    <br>
    <b> Although </b> I wish I could eat everything in this world without having to worry about <i> my health, calories,
      and much more. </i>
